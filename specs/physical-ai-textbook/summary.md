# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Project - Phase 1 Summary

## Project Overview
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Project is a comprehensive educational platform that combines a 10-chapter textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics with advanced AI features including a RAG chatbot, user authentication, and personalized content delivery.

## Core Deliverables
1. **AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation**: Docusaurus-based textbook deployed to GitHub Pages
2. **Integrated RAG Chatbot**: Using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud
3. **User Authentication**: Better-Auth with background assessment questions
4. **Personalized Content**: User-customizable content based on background and preferences
5. **Advanced Features**: Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills for reusable intelligence

## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: Docusaurus v3.x with React components for textbook, RAG chatbot, auth, and personalization
- **Backend**: FastAPI services for RAG, authentication, and personalization
- **Database**: Neon Serverless Postgres for user data and metadata
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant Cloud for RAG content embeddings
- **AI Services**: OpenAI Agents/ChatKit for question answering
- **Development**: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus for automation

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for Phase 2 implementation. The next step would be to execute the tasks outlined in the comprehensive task breakdown, starting with the foundational setup (Phases 1-3) followed by the chapter-by-chapter content development with integrated features.

## Bonus Features (Extra Points)
The project includes all requirements for earning up to 150 extra bonus points:
- 50 points: Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills implementation
- 50 points: Better-Auth with background assessment questions
- 50 points: Personalized content delivery system

## Technology Stack Compliance
All required technologies from the project requirements have been incorporated:
- ✅ Docusaurus for textbook
- ✅ OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs for RAG
- ✅ FastAPI for backend services
- ✅ Neon Serverless Postgres for database
- ✅ Qdrant Cloud Free Tier for vector storage
