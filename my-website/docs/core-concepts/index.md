# Core Concepts in Physical AI

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts underlying Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with embodied AI systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in digital environments, Physical AI must handle real-world challenges such as:

- Sensing and interpreting physical environments
- Dealing with uncertainty and noise in sensor data
- Controlling physical actuators to perform tasks
- Adapting to dynamic environments
- Ensuring safety when operating in human spaces

## Key Components of Physical AI Systems

A typical Physical AI system consists of:

1. **Sensors**: Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, tactile sensors for world perception
2. **Actuators**: Motors, servos, grippers for physical interaction
3. **Processing Unit**: CPUs, GPUs, or specialized hardware for AI computation
4. **Control Systems**: Algorithms for decision-making and motor control
5. **Communication**: Networks for coordination and remote operation

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are particularly interesting for several reasons:

- **Human Compatibility**: Their form factor is compatible with human-designed environments
- **Social Interaction**: Human-like appearance can enhance human-robot interaction
- **Generalization**: Capabilities developed for humanoid robots can potentially transfer to other domains

## Challenges in Physical AI

Working with Physical AI presents unique challenges:

- **Real-time Constraints**: Systems must react quickly to environmental changes
- **Safety**: Ensuring safe operation around humans and in unpredictable environments
- **Embodiment**: The physical form affects what the AI system can do and how it perceives the world
- **Embodiment**: The physical form affects what the AI system can do and how it perceives the world
- **Uncertainty**: Real-world perception is noisy and incomplete

In the following sections, we'll explore these concepts in more detail, with practical examples and implementation strategies.
