This file represents multi-modal-fusion.png
The image should show:
- Three input streams: Visual (camera icon), Linguistic (speech bubble), Action Context (robot icon)
- Processing layers showing Early Fusion, Intermediate Fusion, and Late Fusion approaches
- Neural network layers combining information from different modalities
- Output: Unified representation suitable for action generation
- Comparison of different fusion strategies and their trade-offs
