# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This resource is designed to bridge the gap between digital brain and physical body - exploring how artificial intelligence systems can be embodied in physical forms, particularly humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers essential topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

- **Introduction to Physical AI**: Foundations of AI Systems in the Physical World
- **ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System**: Understanding Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
- **Simulation Environments**: Gazebo & Unity for Digital Twins
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: The AI-Robot Brain
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Voice-to-Action systems and cognitive planning
- **Humanoid Robot Development**: Kinematics, dynamics, bipedal locomotion
- **Conversational Robotics**: Integrating GPT and NLU for human-robot interaction
- **Perception & Sensors**: Depth cameras, LiDAR, IMU, sensor fusion
- **Lab & Hardware Architectures**: On-Prem and Cloud solutions
- **Capstone Project**: Building an Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Target Audiences

This textbook is designed for:

- **Complete Beginners**: No programming background required
- **CS/Engineering Students**: Academic foundation
