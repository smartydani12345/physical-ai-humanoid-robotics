# AI in Physical Systems

This section explores how artificial intelligence differs when applied to physical systems compared to purely digital environments.

## Digital AI vs. Physical AI

Traditional AI operates in well-defined digital environments with precise, deterministic inputs. Physical AI, however, must handle:

- **Uncertain Perception**: Sensors provide noisy, incomplete data about the world
- **Continuous Control**: Physical systems operate in continuous spaces, unlike discrete digital domains
- **Temporal Constraints**: Real-time processing requirements for safety and responsiveness
- **Embodied Cognition**: AI behavior is fundamentally shaped by its physical form

## Key AI Techniques for Physical Systems

### Perception
- Computer vision for scene understanding
- Sensor fusion to combine multiple data sources
- State estimation to model the environment

### Planning
- Motion planning for navigation and manipulation
- Task planning for goal-directed behavior
- Uncertainty-aware planning to handle environmental unknowns

### Learning
- Reinforcement learning for control policy optimization
- Imitation learning from human demonstrations
- Transfer learning between simulation and reality

## Safety and Ethics

Physical AI systems must be designed with safety as the primary consideration:

- **Fail-safe mechanisms**: Systems must fail in safe ways
- **Human-robot interaction**: Ensuring safe and intuitive interaction
- **Privacy**: Protecting personal data gathered by physical AI systems
- **Accountability**: Determining responsibility for AI-driven actions

## Simulation vs. Reality

The "reality gap" refers to differences between simulated environments and the real world:

- Simulations may not capture all physical phenomena
- Sensor noise and uncertainty are difficult to model perfectly
- Transfer learning techniques help bridge the gap between sim and reality

Understanding these concepts is fundamental to developing effective and safe physical AI systems.
